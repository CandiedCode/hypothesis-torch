# Contributing to `hypothesis-torch`

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Trunk-based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Trunk-based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested (i.e any changes to the `hypothesis-torch` package source code), add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
    - Include examples, using doctest format!
    - We use [Google-style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html), so please follow that format.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
    - Linters are run in Github Actions on every PR, so you can check the status of your PR to see if it passes.
    - To reproduce locally, run
        ```bash
        ruff check
        ruff format
        ```
    - `ruff` can also automatically fix many linting errors with the `--fix` flag.
    - Optionally, you can use the pre-commit hooks by running `pre-commit install` in the root of the repository, which will run the linters on every commit.
6. Please use thorough, clear commit messages, with a target audience of end users. These commit messages will be automatically used to generate the changelog.
    - Consequently, using [Atomic Git Commits](https://dev.to/samuelfaure/how-atomic-git-commits-dramatically-increased-my-productivity-and-will-increase-yours-too-4a84) is a good practice to keep the changelog clean.
7. Submit that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/qthequartermasterman/hypothesis-torch/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/qthequartermasterman/hypothesis-torch/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

If a bug has a serious security concern, please reach out directly to the maintainers.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. Preferably, this is a minimal reproducible example.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
